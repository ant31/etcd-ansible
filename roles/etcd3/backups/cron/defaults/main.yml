# NOTE: Automated backups support multiple encryption methods
#
# Encryption methods:
#   - aws-kms: AWS KMS client-side encryption (requires AWS CLI, credentials, kms:Encrypt/Decrypt)
#   - symmetric: OpenSSL AES-256-CBC encryption (requires step_ca_backup_password in vault.yml)
#   - none: No encryption (not recommended for production)
#
# AWS CLI is automatically downloaded when encryption method is 'aws-kms'
# Credentials passed via environment variables from vault.yml
