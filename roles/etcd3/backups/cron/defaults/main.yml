# NOTE: Automated backups support multiple encryption methods
#
# Encryption methods:
#   - aws-kms: AWS KMS client-side encryption (requires AWS CLI, credentials, kms:Encrypt/Decrypt)
#   - symmetric: OpenSSL AES-256-CBC encryption (requires step_ca_backup_password in vault.yml)
#   - none: No encryption (not recommended for production)
#
# AWS CLI is automatically downloaded when encryption method is 'aws-kms'
# Credentials passed via environment variables from vault.yml

# Distributed backup strategy (high availability)
# Two modes:
#
# 1. DISTRIBUTED MODE (default): Coordinated backups with deduplication
#    - All nodes attempt backups, staggered across the interval
#    - Each node checks S3 before creating backup (prevents duplicates)
#    - Formula: offset = (node_index - 1) * (interval / cluster_size)
#    - Example: 5 nodes, 60min interval = offsets 0,12,24,36,48 minutes
#    - Result: One backup per interval (node 1 succeeds, others skip)
#
# 2. INDEPENDENT MODE: Uncoordinated backups for higher frequency
#    - All nodes create backups independently (no S3 check)
#    - Use larger base interval with frequent node attempts
#    - Example: 5-hour base, 1-hour node attempts = backup every hour
#    - Result: Multiple backups per interval (different node each hour)
